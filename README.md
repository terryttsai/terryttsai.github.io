This website is my personal photography portfolio. 

It is designed to eliminate as much distraction as possible and provide a smooth, pleasing photo-viewing experience.

I spent a lot of effort making sure the UI experience is perfected. For example, the image galleries center the images in an image container nicely. Also clicking anywhere outside of menu closes the menu. 

In my jQuery, I made it so that the page doesn't fade into view until all images have been loaded, so no image shows up half-loaded.

I tucked away navigation into a menu icon. Also put quiet little < > arrows to tell the user to click left and right or the left and right arrow keys. For style, I placed my logo at the bottom of the page in image galleries. 

I vectorized my logo as well.

I web-optimized all my photos, which greatly sped up load times.
